# Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-Hydraulic-Fracture-Behavior
Hydraulic fracturing boosts oil/gas recovery in unconventional reservoirs. This project uses machine learning to predict minimum horizontal stress (FID_SH_MIN_VTI) and optimize fracturing strategies via well log and geomechanical data, enhancing reservoir management and decision-making.
